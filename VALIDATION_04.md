2. Review logs from application startup
3. Verify log format and required entries

**Expected Results**:
- `[TIMESTAMP] [DEBUG] [INIT_STATE]` log present with full `persistentState` dump
- `[TIMESTAMP] [INFO] [SCREEN_LOAD]` log present with `"reason": "Initial Load"`
- All logs follow format: `[TIMESTAMP] [LEVEL] [ACTION] - {DETAILS}`
- Timestamps are in ISO 8601 format
