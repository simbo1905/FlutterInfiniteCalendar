## Grading Criteria

Tests are evaluated on a pass/fail basis. Final grade is calculated as:

- **A (95-100% pass)**: All tests pass, polished UX, no bugs
- **B (80-94% pass)**: Core functionality works, minor visual or interaction issues
- **C (60-79% pass)**: Core features functional but with significant bugs
- **D (40-59% pass)**: Major features broken or incomplete
- **F (<40% pass)**: Application unusable or fails to launch

**CRITICAL tests** (must pass to continue any testing):
- Test 1: Trivial Test - Confirms Setup
- Test 2: Trivial DnD Sanity Test

**High priority tests** (must pass for C or higher):
- Test 3: Application Launch and Initial State
- Test 8: Add Meal to Empty Day
- Test 10: Delete Meal Card
- Test 12: Move Card Between Days
- Test 16: Reorder Cards Within Same Day
- Test 19: Save and Reset

**Standard tests** (must pass for B or higher):
- All remaining Tests 4-23

**Note**: If Tests 1 and 2 fail, **stop testing immediately**. The demo is not viable and further debugging would waste time. Focus on getting the critical path working first.
