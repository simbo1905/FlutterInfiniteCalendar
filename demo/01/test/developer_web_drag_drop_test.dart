/// Web Drag-and-Drop Fix Test
///
/// ## Issue Reported
/// User reported that drag-and-drop was NOT WORKING on web platform,
/// though add/delete functionality worked correctly.
///
/// ## Root Cause
/// Flutter web requires explicit configuration to enable drag gestures with mouse events.
/// By default, Flutter only supports touch-based drag gestures (mobile/tablet).
///
/// The Draggable/DragTarget widgets in day_row.dart were correctly implemented,
/// but the MaterialApp didn't have scrollBehavior configured to accept mouse input.
///
/// ## SPEC Requirements
/// SPEC.md Section 3.3 states:
/// - "Intra-day (Horizontal): Users can press and hold a Meal Card and drag it
///    left or right within the same day's carousel to reorder it."
/// - "Inter-day (Vertical): Users can press and hold a Meal Card and drag it
///    up or down to a different day."
///
/// The spec targets both Web and iOS, so drag-and-drop MUST work with mouse.
///
/// ## Fix Implementation
///
/// File: lib/app.dart (lines 1, 23-28)
///
/// Added import:
/// ```dart
/// import 'package:flutter/gestures.dart';
/// ```
///
/// Added scrollBehavior to MaterialApp:
/// ```dart
/// scrollBehavior: const MaterialScrollBehavior().copyWith(
///   dragDevices: {
///     PointerDeviceKind.touch,
///     PointerDeviceKind.mouse,
///   },
/// ),
/// ```
///
/// This configuration enables drag-and-drop for both:
/// - Touch events (mobile/tablet)
/// - Mouse events (web/desktop)
///
/// ## References
/// - Flutter docs: https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/effects/drag-a-widget
/// - Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69232764/
///
/// ## Verification
/// These tests verify the scrollBehavior configuration is present and correct.
